## 📊 Project Dashboard (User Interface)

This directory contains the source code for the interactive Streamlit Dashboard developed for the FCPS Meal Production Forecasting project.
This web application serves as the frontend interface, enabling users to visualize meal production trends, evaluate model results, and generate actionable insights

## 🖼️ Overview

The dashboard provides stakeholders (FCPS nutrition staff, analysts, and decision-makers) with a unified interface to explore forecasting results generated by Machine Learning and Deep Learning models.

It includes four primary pages:
	1.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visual insights into historical production costs, participation trends, and waste patterns across schools.
	2.	Model Comparison
Side-by-side performance comparison of Linear Regression, XGBoost, FNN, GRU, and LSTM models used for time-series forecasting.
	3.	Forecasting Interface
Interactive tools allowing users to forecast production costs for a specific school, specific meal, or all schools district-wide for a selected horizon.
	4.	Recommendation Engine
Automatically generates insights for overproduction/underproduction, cost anomalies, and improvement opportunities.

## 🔧 Prerequisites

Before running the dashboard, ensure the following steps are completed:

1. Run the Data Pipeline

The dashboard reads cleaned CSVs and model outputs generated by the backend.
Execute the full pipeline:

```bash
python src/main/main.py
```
2. Install UI Dependencies

Install Streamlit and all required libraries:
```bash
pip install -r ../requirements.txt
```
## 🚀 How to Run
To launch the web application locally:

Navigate to the project root directory.
Run the following command:
```bash
streamlit run demo/streamlit_app.py
```
