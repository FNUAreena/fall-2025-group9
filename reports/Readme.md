# Overview

This folder serves as the documentation hub for the entire project.
It includes:
- Draft and final versions of the main capstone report
- Progress reports submitted at different stages
- Markdown notes and structure files to support writing and formatting
- Figures, tables, and explanations used across the written reports
  
These documents align with GWU’s capstone deliverable requirements and provide a complete written record of the problem, dataset, pipeline, models, results, and conclusions.
